Perform Histogram Equalization to obtain contrast-enhanced images (Refer to lecture slides for concept understanding)

 (Can use C++, Python, MATLAB, or any programming language) 



REPORT should contain:

1. Code (if possible with comments)

2. Input and Output Image (along with their histograms)

3. (Optional) Histogram Equalization can be performed globally (for an  entire image) and locally (in a block-wise manner). Full marks for the  execution of both.



Check Attachment for Sample Test Images (Any appropriate image can be used). Thanks
